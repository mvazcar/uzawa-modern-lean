# Modern proofs of Uzawa's theorem in Lean

Two checked representation arguments, with **63 main theorems and 3 additional
obstruction lemmas**, explicit assumptions, and a comparison of the modern
source versions. Start with the published Jones–Scrimgeour/Schlicht route.

The original reference is Hirofumi Uzawa (1961), *Neutral Inventions and the
Stability of Growth Equilibrium*, Review of Economic Studies 28(2), 117–124,
[DOI 10.2307/2295709](https://doi.org/10.2307/2295709). This repository currently
formalizes modern arguments, not all results or the original proof in that
article. See [the original-source status and extension plan](docs/uzawa-1961-source.md).

## What the two proofs establish

| Route | Assumptions that matter | Conclusion |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Published Jones–Scrimgeour (2008), using Schlicht's idea with its correction | Exponential paths for output, consumption, investment, capital and labour; resource and accumulation equations; positive investment, capital and labour; nonnegative consumption; constant returns at a reference date | Along that path, output equals the reference technology evaluated at capital and labour augmented at the output-per-worker growth rate |
| Repaired elasticity route | Positive differentiable intensive output, capital share below one, full positive range for the capital/output coordinate, and shares invariant across time at **every** positive capital/output coordinate | A domain-wide labour-augmenting representation; the same balanced-growth accounting then calibrates its technology factor on the path |

For the first route, if the reference date is $\tau$, then

$$Y(t)=F(K(t),A(t)L(t),\tau),\qquad A(t)=e^{(g_Y-n)(t-\tau)},\qquad t\geq\tau.$$

The first conclusion is an on-path representation, not a statement about every
counterfactual input combination. The second route has stronger global
assumptions. Both share the growth-accounting lemma; their representation
arguments are different. Neither requires an external solver as a proof oracle.

The literal November 2004 working-paper assumptions admit a zero-investment
boundary case. Three obstruction lemmas check why that case cannot have the
claimed representation with a constant-returns, strictly capital-increasing
technology and the specified exponential labour augmentation. A full formal
encoding of all derivative and Inada conditions of that countermodel is not
claimed. The repaired route is explicitly stronger than the 2004 statement.

## Reproduce the verification

Install [Lean through elan](https://github.com/leanprover/elan) and Python 3.12+,
then run from this repository:

```sh
lake exe cache get
python scripts/verify.py
```

Lean and Mathlib are pinned to **v4.34.0-rc2**, with transitive revisions in
`lake-manifest.json`. The script builds the library, freshly recompiles the
proof sources without importing their compiled project modules, and checks
each named theorem's axiom dependencies. Only Lean's standard `propext`,
`Classical.choice`, and `Quot.sound` are allowed. Warnings, failed proofs, and
placeholder axioms fail verification. Mathlib's Apache-specific header style
rule is disabled because this independent distribution uses The Unlicense;
the mathematical and other style checks remain enabled.

The checked source hashes, theorem names, and axiom lists are recorded in
[verification/verification.json](verification/verification.json). GitHub Actions
repeats the build and fresh audit on pushes and pull requests. A JSON record is
evidence of a run; the Lean proof terms and kernel checks are the certificates.

## Development and credit

Developed primarily with **OpenAI Codex**, under the direction of the
TheoryDebugger project maintainer, who chooses the research questions and
reviews the economic interpretation. Codex assists with source comparison,
proof development, implementation, documentation, and tests. This follows
[LeanEconomics' transparent attribution of AI assistance](https://github.com/LeanEconomics/LeanEconomics#provenance).
LeanEconomics credits Claude for its own development; that credit is not a claim
that Claude wrote these new modules. Lean verifies the encoded statements;
their economic interpretation still requires researcher review.

The modules were first developed as independent proposed LeanEconomics
contributions. [proof-manifest.json](proof-manifest.json) records the original
commits and source hashes. This standalone library changes the project namespace,
imports, and license header while preserving the mathematical proof bodies.

[TheoryDebugger](https://github.com/mvazcar/TheoryDebugger) helped diagnose
assumptions, boundary cases, and algebraic proof steps. Its external solver is
not a trusted oracle or a runtime dependency of this library. The complete
proofs here use Lean and Mathlib.
